# Six Legged Robot - Hectarus - Simulation with ROS2 Jazzy and Gazebo Harmonic
A ROS2-based simulation of a six-legged (hexapod) robot using Gazebo Harmonic, built for research and learning in robotics and mechatronics.

This project features a real-time teleoperation using keyboard input, torque monitoring for each joint, and IMU-based static self-stabilization.

## Features
### 3D Hexapod Model

### Keyboard Teleoperation

### Torque Monitoring

### Basic IMU Integration


##Prerequisites

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```ruby

```
2. Build the workspace
```ruby
cd ~/ros2_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

## Usage
1. Launch the Simulation
2. Control the Robot
3. Monitor Joint Torque
4. Activate Imu Self-Stabilization
